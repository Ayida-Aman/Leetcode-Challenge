# 10 Days of JavaScript - Day 1: Let and Const 🚀

## 📌 Overview

This challenge focuses on understanding **variable declarations** in JavaScript using `let` and `const`. Unlike `var`, these keywords provide better **scope control** and prevent unintended modifications.

## 🏆 Objective

- Learn the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`.
- Understand **block scope** and immutability.
- Practice declaring variables correctly for different scenarios.

## 📂 Problem Breakdown

- **`let`** allows reassignment but is block-scoped.
- **`const`** is immutable and must be assigned a value during declaration.
- Proper usage leads to cleaner, more predictable code.

## 📌 Example Scenario

You’ll declare and modify variables while ensuring correct **scoping and restrictions** using `let` and `const`.
