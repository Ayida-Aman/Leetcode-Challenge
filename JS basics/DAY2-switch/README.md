# 10 Days of JavaScript - Day 2: Conditional Statements (Switch) 🚀

## 📌 Overview

This challenge focuses on **switch statements** in JavaScript, a structured way to handle multiple conditional cases efficiently.

## 🏆 Objective

- Understand how **switch-case** structures work.
- Use `case` statements to handle different inputs.
- Apply **break** to prevent unintended execution.

## 📂 Problem Breakdown

- `switch` evaluates an **expression**, matching it to different `case` values.
- `default` acts as a fallback when no case matches.
- `break` ensures execution stops after a match.

## 📌 Example Scenario

Given a character input, the program will return a corresponding category using a `switch` statement.
