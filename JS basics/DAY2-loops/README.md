# 10 Days of JavaScript - Day 2: Loops 🚀

## 📌 Overview

This challenge focuses on **loops** in JavaScript, a fundamental concept for running repeated actions efficiently. You’ll learn how to cycle through data and automate repetitive tasks.

## 🏆 Objective

- Understand different types of loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- Use loops to iterate over arrays and sequences.
- Optimize loop structures for efficiency.

## 📂 Problem Breakdown

- `for` loops iterate a fixed number of times.
- `while` loops run while a condition remains true.
- `do-while` ensures execution at least once before checking a condition.

## 📌 Example Scenario

Given an array, you’ll use a loop to traverse and process each element efficiently.
