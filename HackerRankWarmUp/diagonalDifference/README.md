# Diagonal Difference 🚀

🟢 **Easy**

## 📌 Overview

This is a **warm-up problem** labeled as **Easy** on HackerRank. It introduces **matrix operations** and absolute differences. You'll practice working with square matrices and computing diagonal sums efficiently.

## 🏆 Objective

- Take a square matrix as input.
- Compute the sum of its **primary** and **secondary** diagonals.
- Return the absolute difference between the two sums.

## 📂 Problem Breakdown

- The matrix is **n x n**, meaning it has equal rows and columns.
- The **primary diagonal** runs from the top-left to the bottom-right.
- The **secondary diagonal** runs from the top-right to the bottom-left.
- Compute both sums and return their absolute difference.

## 📌 Example Scenario

If given the matrix:

11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

The primary diagonal sum is `11 + 5 + (-12) = 4`.  
The secondary diagonal sum is `4 + 5 + 10 = 19`.  
The absolute difference is `|4 - 19| = 15`.
