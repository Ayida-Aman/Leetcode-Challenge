# A Very Big Sum 🚀

🟢 **Easy**

## 📌 Overview

This is a **warm-up problem** labeled as **Easy** on HackerRank. It introduces **handling large numbers** in programming. You'll practice working with integer arrays and computing their sum efficiently, ensuring the result doesn't exceed standard integer limits.

## 🏆 Objective

- Take an array of integers as input.
- Compute and return the sum of its elements.
- Handle large numbers properly to avoid overflow issues.

## 📂 Problem Breakdown

- The function will receive an array of integers.
- Using a loop or built-in methods, you will compute the sum.
- Return the result as the output, ensuring it can handle large values.

## 📌 Example Scenario

If given `arr = [1000000001, 1000000002, 1000000003, 1000000004, 1000000005]`, the output should be `5000000015`.
