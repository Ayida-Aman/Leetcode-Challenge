**#Leetcode hundred days challenge**

_This repository provides a structured progression of 100 coding questions, ranging from basic concepts to advanced algorithms and system design. The questions are divided into five categories to help anyone who wants to work on their problem solving skills build confidence step-by-step. These problems are organized by me to help me learn JavaScript by solving problems. The topics were recommended by ChatGPT, and the solutions are my own, but they may not always be the best since i am starting out so make sure to try something different._

**##Problem Set Overview**

1. Basic Arithmetic and Simple Logic (1-10)

Simple operations like addition, subtraction, and finding prime numbers.

Fundamental string manipulations, like reversing strings and counting vowels.

2. Basic Data Structures (11-30)

Working with arrays: sorting, merging, and removing duplicates.

Introduction to stack and queue implementation.

Exploring intersections and rotations of arrays.

3. Intermediate Problems (31-60)

Algorithmic problems like binary search and balanced parentheses.

Linked list operations: insertion, deletion, and cycle detection.

String challenges like compression and finding substrings.

4. Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (61-90)

Binary tree operations: traversal, height calculation, and ancestor search.

Dynamic programming problems like "climbing stairs" and "coin change."

Complex operations: hash tables, permutations, and knapsack problems.

5. Complex Problems and System Design (91-100)

Advanced algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Kadane’s.

System design challenges: web crawler, chat app, and simple API development.

Sorting algorithms: merge sort and quicksort.
