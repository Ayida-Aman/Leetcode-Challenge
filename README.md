#Leetcode challenge for beginners

Welcome to the LeetCode Challenge repository! This repo is dedicated to solving problems as a means to learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for absolute beginners. My team and I have designed a structured approach to learning DSA through hands-on practice.

##Learning Path

1. JavaScript Basics

   We will kick off our journey by learning the fundamentals of JavaScript using the "10 Days of JavaScript" challenge on HackerRank. We will focus exclusively on the sections relevant to DSA. You can access the link [HERE](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript).

2. Warm-Up Questions  
   After mastering the basics, we will tackle 10 warm-up questions on HackerRank to prepare ourselves for more complex DSA problems. You can find the warm-up questions [HERE](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=warmup&badge_type=problem-solving).

3. Implementation
   After solving 10 warm up question we will solve some implementation problems on Hacker Rank to get ourselves more familier with Javascript. You can find the implementation questions [HERE](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=implementation).

4. DSA for Beginners  
   Next, we will dive into DSA concepts using Neetcode's course, tackling one topic per day. Each topic will include one or more problems to solve, allowing us to practice and reinforce our understanding. You can get the link [HERE](https://neetcode.io/courses/dsa-for-beginners).

5. Neetcode 150 Questions  
   Once we complete the instructional videos, we will proceed to the Neetcode 150 questions problem set. Our goal will be to solve one LeetCode question each day. You can also get the link [HERE](https://neetcode.io/practice).
