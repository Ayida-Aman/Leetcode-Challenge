# LeetCode Challenge for Beginners 🚀

## 📌 Overview

Welcome to the **LeetCode Challenge** repository! This repo is dedicated to solving problems as a way to learn **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** for absolute beginners. My team and I have designed a structured approach to mastering DSA through hands-on practice.

## 📖 Learning Path

### 1️⃣ JavaScript Basics

We will kick off our journey by learning the fundamentals of JavaScript using the **"10 Days of JavaScript"** challenge on HackerRank. We will focus exclusively on sections relevant to DSA.

### 2️⃣ Warm-Up Questions

After mastering the basics, we will tackle **10 warm-up questions** on HackerRank to prepare ourselves for more complex DSA problems.

### 3️⃣ Implementation Problems

After solving the warm-up questions, we will move on to **implementation problems** on HackerRank to get more familiar with JavaScript.

### 4️⃣ DSA for Beginners

Next, we will dive into **DSA concepts** using Neetcode’s course, tackling **one topic per day**. Each topic will include one or more problems to solve, allowing us to practice and reinforce our understanding.

### 5️⃣ Neetcode 150 Questions

Once we complete the instructional videos, we will proceed to the **Neetcode 150** question set. Our goal is to solve **one LeetCode question per day** to deepen our problem-solving skills.
