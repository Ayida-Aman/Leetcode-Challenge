# Between Two Sets 🚀

🟢 **Easy**

## 📌 Overview

This is an **implementation problem** labeled as **Easy** on HackerRank. It introduces **number divisibility and factors** to determine integers that lie between two sets. You'll practice handling arrays and mathematical operations to find valid numbers.

## 🏆 Objective

- Take two arrays of integers as input.
- Find numbers that are **multiples of all elements in the first array**.
- Ensure those numbers are **factors of all elements in the second array**.
- Count how many such numbers exist.

## 📂 Problem Breakdown

- Identify the **Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)** of the first array.
- Identify the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of the second array.
- Count numbers that are multiples of the LCM and factors of the GCD.

## 📌 Example Scenario

If given:
a = [2, 4]
b = [16, 32, 96]
The output should be: 3
