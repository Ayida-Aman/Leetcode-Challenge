# Grading Students 🚀

🟢 **Easy**

## 📌 Overview

This is an **implementation problem** labeled as **Easy** on HackerRank. It introduces **rounding logic** based on grading rules. You'll practice handling conditional statements to adjust student grades based on specific criteria.

## 🏆 Objective

- Take an array of student grades as input.
- Round grades **up** if they are close to the next multiple of `5`.
- Ensure grades below `38` remain unchanged, as they are failing grades.

## 📂 Problem Breakdown

- If a grade is **less than 38**, it remains unchanged.
- If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of `5` is **less than 3**, round it up.
- Otherwise, keep the grade as is.

## 📌 Example Scenario

If given `grades = [73, 67, 38, 33]`, the output should be:
75
67
40
33
