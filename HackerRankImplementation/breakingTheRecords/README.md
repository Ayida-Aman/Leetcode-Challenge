# Breaking the Records 🚀

🟢 **Easy**

## 📌 Overview

This is an **implementation problem** labeled as **Easy** on HackerRank. It introduces **tracking performance records** over a season. You'll practice handling arrays and conditional logic to determine how many times a player breaks their best and worst records.

## 🏆 Objective

- Take an array of scores as input.
- Track the number of times the **highest** and **lowest** records are broken.
- Return the count of record-breaking instances.

## 📂 Problem Breakdown

- The first score sets the initial **best** and **worst** records.
- Each subsequent score is compared to update the records.
- Count how many times the best and worst records are broken.

## 📌 Example Scenario

If given `scores = [10, 5, 20, 20, 4, 5, 2, 25, 1]`, the output should be: 2 4

This means the best record was broken **2 times**, and the worst record was broken **4 times**.
