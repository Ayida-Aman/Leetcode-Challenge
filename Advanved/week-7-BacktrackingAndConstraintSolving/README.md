# 🧩 Week 4: Backtracking & Constraint Solving

Welcome to Week 4, team! This week we dive into the world of **backtracking**—a powerful technique for solving problems that require exploring multiple possibilities while respecting constraints. Think of it as building a recursive search tree and pruning paths that don’t work.

Each day, you’ll tackle a new challenge that strengthens your ability to:
- Manage recursive state
- Apply constraints intelligently
- Build elegant, efficient solutions

Let’s unlock the logic behind puzzles, grids, and combinatorics!
