# 🧠 Dynamic Programming Set for DSA & Interview Prep

Welcome to **Week 1** of our DSA challenge series, where we’re kicking things off with one of the most foundational techniques in algorithmic problem-solving: **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. This handpicked set of LeetCode problems spans core DP flavors—from subset partitioning to movement optimization—all designed to build your muscle memory for overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

Let’s break problems down—and rise one state transition at a time. 🚀

## 📋 Problem List

| # | Problem Title | Difficulty | Description |
|---|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Last Stone Weight II](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/) | Medium | Treat it like a subset sum problem—balance two piles to minimize the last stone. Classic 0/1 Knapsack adaptation. |
| 2 | [Minimum Falling Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum/) | Medium | Move through a matrix with minimal cost. Grid-based bottom-up DP with vertical constraints. |
| 3 | [Dungeon Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/) | Hard | Survive a dungeon with minimum health—reverse DP with tight constraints on damage and healing. |
| 4 | [2 Keys Keyboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/2-keys-keyboard/) | Medium | Reach the target using optimal copy-paste operations. Think of it like building numbers with minimal operations. |
| 5 | [Minimum Number of Refueling Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-refueling-stops/) | Hard | Greedy meets DP in this fuel-station puzzle. Optimize for the fewest refuels to reach your destination. |
| 6 | [Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-stay-in-the-same-place-after-some-steps/) | Hard | 3D DP with step and position tracking—constrained movement under modulo arithmetic. |
| 7 | [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/) | Hard | Transform one word to another with the fewest edits. A DP classic every interviewer loves. |

## 💡 Why Dynamic Programming?

DP helps us:

- Break complex problems into manageable subproblems
- Reduce brute-force time through memoization or tabulation
- Build solutions with clear recurrence relations and base cases

It’s a pillar of algorithmic thinking—and a frequent guest in top-tier interviews.
