## 📋 Problem List

| # | Problem Title | Difficulty | Description |
|---|---------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/) | Medium | Find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array. Think ahead—greedily maximize your reach. |
| 2 | [Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/) | Medium | Break a string into parts so that no letter appears in more than one part. A perfect example of greedy boundary marking. |
| 3 | [Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/) | Medium | Use the fewest arrows to burst overlapping balloons. Master the art of interval merging. |
| 4 | [Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/) | Hard | Distribute candies based on ratings. Everyone must get at least one and higher-rated kids more than their neighbors. Requires a two-pass greedy approach. |
| 5 | [Create Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/) | Hard | Select digits from two arrays to create the largest number possible. Greedy + stack manipulation at its finest. |
| 6 | [Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/) | Hard | Optimize cost under a wage-to-quality constraint. Heap meets greedy in this cost-efficient challenge. |
| 7 | [IPO](https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/) | Hard | Maximize capital by selecting profitable projects within budget limits. A priority queue-powered greedy selection problem. |

## 💡 Why Greedy?

Greedy algorithms teach us how to:
- Make the best decision at each step
- Optimize time and space complexity
- Build a solid foundation for dynamic programming

They're often deceptively simple—and a favorite in interviews!
