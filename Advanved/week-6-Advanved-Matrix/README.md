## 🧠 Goals

- Strengthen your understanding of grid-based traversal techniques
- Master BFS, DFS, and dynamic programming in 2D space
- Learn to manage complex states (bitmasking, health tracking, multi-agent movement)
- Practice visual debugging and edge-case analysis

---

## 🧩 Tips for Success

- 🔍 **Visualize** your grid: draw it out or log it step-by-step
- 🧵 **Trace your paths**: use recursion stacks or queues to debug traversal
- 🧠 **Think in states**: track position, keys collected, health, or direction
- 🧪 **Test edge cases**: empty grids, blocked paths, max constraints

---

## 🏆 Bonus Challenge

On Day 7, host a mini hackathon:
- Solve *Escape the Spreading Fire* under time pressure
- Share strategies and optimizations
- Celebrate the most elegant or creative solution!
