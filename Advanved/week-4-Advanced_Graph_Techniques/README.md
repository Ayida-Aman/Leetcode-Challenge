## ✅ How to Use This Set

Each day this week:

- ✍️ **Solve the assigned problem**
- 🔗 **Share your solution or approach in your group thread**
- 💬 **Discuss graph traversal techniques and edge cases with your peers**

Group leads, be sure to update your Week 6 checklist to track submissions and streaks! 📊

## 💡 Why Graph Theory?

Graph algorithms help us:

- Model real-world relationships (maps, tasks, dependencies)
- Detect cycles and deadlocks in systems
- Order tasks when constraints are present
- Optimize traversal in both breadth and depth

These concepts show up in interviews, projects, and large-scale systems. Mastering them is like unlocking a new level of algorithmic thinking. 🎮
