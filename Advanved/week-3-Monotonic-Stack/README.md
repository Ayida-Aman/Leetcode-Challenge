## 📋 Problem List

| # | Problem Title | Difficulty | Description |
|---|-----------------------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/) | Easy | Discover the next greater element for each item in a subset of an array. Introduction to forward-pass stack thinking. |
| 2 | [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/) | Medium | Find out how many days until a warmer temperature—classic example of using a stack to track future indices. |
| 3 | [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/) | Hard | A canonical stack problem where you calculate the largest possible rectangle in a histogram. |
| 4 | [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) | Hard | Stack meets two-pointer technique to solve elevation-based water trapping. |
| 5 | [Maximal Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/) | Hard | Extend the histogram logic to a 2D binary matrix. Combines dynamic programming with stack intuition. |
| 6 | [Remove K Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/) | Medium | Build the smallest number by removing digits—greedy stack manipulation at its finest. |
| 7 | [Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/) | Hard | Trickier variant involving monotonic stacks + dynamic programming for subarray analysis. |

## 💡 Why Monotonic Stacks?

Monotonic stacks are an advanced pattern that help you:

- Optimize range-based problems with linear time logic
- Master stack behavior in combination with greedy thinking
- Prepare for questions that blend space-efficient algorithms with dynamic input

They’re also **top-tier favorites** in interviews and contests—both because they test precision and because they’re hard to brute-force!
