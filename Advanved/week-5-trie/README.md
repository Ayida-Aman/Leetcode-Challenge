# üîç Advanced Week Challenge: Trie & String Algorithms (LeetCode Only)

Welcome to another week of deep dives and brain burns! This time, we‚Äôre exploring the power of **Tries**‚Äîa data structure that shines in prefix-based problems, dictionary lookups, and even bitwise operations. Each day brings a new twist, from wildcard searches to palindrome pairs and streaming suffix matches.

## üß† Why Tries?

Tries are perfect for:

- Fast prefix lookups in **O(L)** time
- Autocomplete and spell-check systems
- Combining with DFS, Bitmasking, and HashMaps
- Solving real-world problems like streaming input and XOR logic

## üèÅ Bonus Tips

- Try implementing your own Trie class from scratch at least twice this week.
- Explore how reversing strings can help with suffix-based problems like *Stream of Characters*.
- For *Maximum XOR*, think in binary and build a bitwise Trie!
