# DSA for Beginners 🚀

🟢 **Structured Learning Path**

## 📌 Overview

After completing **HackerRank Implementation questions**, we will transition to **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using Neetcode's **Beginner Course**. This structured approach ensures a **one-topic-per-day** learning system, helping us build a **strong foundation in problem-solving**.

## 🏆 Objective

- Strengthen **DSA concepts** systematically.
- Solve problems to reinforce each **data structure & algorithm**.
- Gain confidence in **problem-solving strategies** for interviews and real-world development.

## 📂 Learning Plan

Each topic will introduce a **DSA concept** with **one or more problems** to solve for practical application.

🔹 **Arrays** – Foundational structure for storing ordered data.  
🔹 **Hashmaps** – Key-value pair storage for efficient lookups.  
🔹 **Linked Lists** – Sequential nodes for flexible data handling.  
🔹 **Stacks & Queues** – First-in, First-out vs Last-in, First-out logic.  
🔹 **Recursion** – Solving complex problems with self-referencing functions.  
🔹 **Trees & Graphs** – Advanced hierarchical and relationship-based data structures.  
🔹 **Dynamic Programming** – Optimization technique for breaking down complex problems.  
🔹 **And more :) **
