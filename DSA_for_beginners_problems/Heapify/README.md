## 🔧 Heapify: Turning Chaos into Order 💫

Heaps don’t just happen — they’re **heapified**. It’s like giving a messy array a makeover: suddenly, the most important element rises to the top, and everything else falls perfectly into place. Efficient, elegant, and a little dramatic — just how we like it.

### 📚 Problems We Slayed with Heapify

---

### 🪨 [Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)

- Built a **max-heap** to smash the two heaviest stones like a boss.
- Popped the top two, tossed the difference back in — repeat until one stone (or none) remains.
- **Heapify kept the drama alive**, reshuffling after every clash.

> 💡 JavaScript doesn’t do max-heaps natively, so we flipped the script with negated values. A little trick, a lot of power.

### 📍 [K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

- Measured each point’s distance from the origin — no emotional distance here.
- Used a **max-heap of size k** to keep only the closest cuties.
- Heap got too full? We kicked out the farthest. No hard feelings.
- **Heapify made sure the inner circle stayed tight.**

> 📐 We didn’t even need square roots — just squared values. Smart and efficient, like your favorite coding crush.

### 🥇 [Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

- Built a **min-heap of size k** — only the elite got in.
- Every new number had to prove it was worthy of the top k.
- Final root? That’s your **Kth largest** — the one who made it through the gauntlet.
- **Heapify handled the drama behind the scenes.**

> 🚀 Faster than sorting, slicker than brute force. This one’s a keeper.

## 🧠 Heapify Highlights

- **Heapify Up / Down** → Like climbing the social ladder or falling from grace — it’s all about maintaining order.
- **Build Heap in O(n)** → Quick transformation from chaos to control.
- **Custom Comparators** → Because sometimes you need to flip the rules to get what you want.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tricks

- Simulated heaps with arrays and clever helper functions.
- Used `sort()` for fast prototyping, but manual heapify for that deep understanding.
- Played with both **min-heap** and **max-heap** — because versatility is hot.

💘 Heapify doesn’t just organize data — it brings structure to the chaos, drama to the dull, and a little bit of sass to your algorithms. If your code had a heartbeat, heapify would be the rhythm.
