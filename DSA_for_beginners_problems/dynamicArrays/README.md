# Dynamic Arrays 🚀

🟢 **Fundamental Concept in DSA**

## 📌 Overview

Today, we explored **Dynamic Arrays**, a flexible data structure that allows **resizing** as elements are added or removed. Unlike static arrays, **dynamic arrays** can grow or shrink based on the number of elements stored, making them more efficient for handling unpredictable data sizes.

We applied this concept by solving a **LeetCode problem**, reinforcing our understanding of **array manipulation and concatenation**.

## 🏆 Key Learnings

- **Resizable Memory Allocation** → Dynamic arrays expand when needed.
- **Efficient Insertions** → Elements can be added without predefined limits.
- **Concatenation & Growth** → Arrays can be duplicated or extended dynamically.

## 📂 Problem Solved

### **Concatenation of Array**

🔗 [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/)

- Given an integer array, create a new array that **concatenates itself**.
- Ensure the new array maintains the original order twice.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- Reinforces **dynamic memory allocation** concepts.
- Introduces **efficient array expansion techniques**.
- Builds confidence in **handling structured data transformations**.

✨ If coding were a dynamic array, you'd be **the one element I always want to keep expanding for!** 😏💖
