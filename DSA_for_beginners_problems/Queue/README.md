# Queue 🧃  

🟡 **Linear Data Structure with FIFO Vibes**  

## 📌 Overview  
Today, we explored the elegant mechanics of **Queues**, a core data structure based on the **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle. Think of it like a line at your favorite smoothie bar—first one in, first one served. 🥤

Queues support operations at opposite ends: you **enqueue** elements at the back and **dequeue** from the front. We implemented and analyzed variations of queues, including **circular queues** and stacks built using queues, leveling up both our conceptual clarity and coding finesse.

## 🏆 Key Learnings  
- **FIFO Principle** → Great for modeling real-world scenarios like scheduling, buffering, and resource sharing.  
- **Implementation Flexibility** → Can be built using arrays, linked lists, or even **two stacks**.  
- **Problem Modeling** → Used extensively in system design, simulations, and traversal algorithms like BFS.

✨ If coding were a queue, you'd never get dequeued—you're always worth the wait. 💻🫶
