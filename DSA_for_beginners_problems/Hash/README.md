# Hashing 💅🔐

🟢 **Fast Lookups, Fierce Logic, and Zero Tolerance for Duplicates**

## 📌 Overview

Today we unlocked the power of **Hashing** — the ultimate tool for fast lookups, instant access, and memory-efficient magic. Whether you're checking for duplicates, hunting for the perfect pair, or managing a cache like a queen, hash maps bring the speed and the sass.

We solved problems that prove one thing: when you’ve got a good hash, you don’t need to search — you just know. 💁‍♀️

## 🏆 Key Learnings

- **Constant-Time Access** → Hash maps let you skip the line and go straight to the answer.
- **Key-Value Pairing** → Store data with meaning and retrieve it like a pro.
- **Collision-Free Thinking** → Handle overlapping values with grace.
- **Eviction Strategy** → LRU Cache taught us how to say “bye” to the least useful — no drama.

## 📂 Problems Solved

### 🧍‍♀️ [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

- Scanned the array and used a hash set to catch repeats instantly.
- If it’s already in the set — boom, duplicate found.
- Fast, clean, and no second chances.

> 💡 Hash sets are like your inner circle — once someone’s in, you’ll know if they try to sneak back.

### 💞 [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

- Found two numbers that add up to a target — in one pass.
- Stored complements in a hash map and checked each new number against it.
- When the right one came along? Instant match.

> 🥹 It’s the algorithmic version of “you complete me.”

### 🧊 [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

- Designed a cache that keeps the most recently used items and evicts the rest.
- Used a hash map + doubly linked list for O(1) access and updates.
- Managed memory like a boss — no freeloaders allowed.

> 🧠 This one’s got brains and boundaries. If you’re not used, you’re out.
