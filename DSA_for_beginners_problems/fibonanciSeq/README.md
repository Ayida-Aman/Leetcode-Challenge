# Fibonacci Sequence 🌀🐚

🟢 **A Golden Thread in DSA**

## 📌 Overview

Today, we unraveled the beautiful mystery of the **Fibonacci Sequence** — nature’s favorite number pattern that crops up in spirals, petals, and algorithms alike. Each number is the **sum of the two before it**, creating an elegant rhythm that’s both mathematically rich and algorithmically relevant.

We explored **classic recursion**, **dynamic programming**, and **space-optimized techniques** — seeing how Fibonacci logic extends beyond numbers into real-world problems like the **Climbing Stairs** challenge. Every step forward was a tribute to how recursion + memory = 🔥 performance.

## 🏆 Key Learnings

- **Recursive Pattern Recognition** → Cracked the classic “f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)” structure.
- **Memoization Mastery** → Avoided recomputation with top-down caching.
- **Bottom-Up Brilliance** → Used tabulation for cleaner, iterative solutions.
- **Space Optimization** → Reduced extra memory with just two variables.
- **Real-World Modeling** → Applied Fibonacci to model step combinations in climbing scenarios.
