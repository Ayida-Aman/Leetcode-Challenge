# Static Arrays 🚀

🟢 **Fundamental Concept in DSA**

## 📌 Overview

Today, we explored **Static Arrays**, a fundamental data structure in programming. Unlike dynamic arrays, **static arrays** have a **fixed size**, meaning they cannot grow or shrink after allocation.

We applied this concept by solving two **LeetCode problems**, reinforcing our understanding of **array manipulation** and **in-place modifications**.

## 🏆 Key Learnings

- **Fixed Size Memory Allocation** → Static arrays allocate a **fixed** amount of memory.
- **In-Place Modifications** → Certain operations modify arrays **without creating new ones**.
- **Efficiency Considerations** → Understanding **space and time complexity** when working with arrays.

## 📂 Problems Solved

### 1️⃣ **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**

🔗 [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

- Remove duplicate elements **in-place** from a sorted array.
- Ensure the final array maintains its original order.

### 2️⃣ **Remove Element**

🔗 [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

- Remove a specific element from the array **in-place**.
- Shift remaining elements and return the new length.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- Reinforces **array traversal and modification** techniques.
- Introduces **in-place operations** for memory-efficient programming.
- Builds confidence in **handling structured data transformations**.

✨ If coding were a static array, you'd be **the one element I never want to replace!** 😏💖
