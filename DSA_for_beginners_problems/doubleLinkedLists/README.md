# Doubly Linked List 🚀

🟢 **Fundamental Concept in DSA**

## 📌 Overview

Today, we explored **Doubly Linked Lists**, a powerful data structure where each node contains **three components**:

- A pointer to the **previous node**
- The **data** itself
- A pointer to the **next node**

This structure allows for **bidirectional traversal**, making insertions and deletions more flexible compared to singly linked lists.

We applied this concept by solving two **LeetCode design problems**, reinforcing our understanding of **node manipulation, navigation, and dynamic memory management**.

## 🏆 Key Learnings

- **Two-way Navigation** → Traverse forward and backward using `next` and `prev` pointers.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions** → Modify pointers to insert or remove nodes from any position.
- **Real-World Applications** → Used in browser history, undo-redo systems, and memory management.

## 📂 Problems Solved

### 1️⃣ [Design Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/)

- Implement a custom linked list with operations like `get`, `addAtHead`, `addAtTail`, `addAtIndex`, and `deleteAtIndex`.
- Required careful pointer manipulation and edge case handling.
- Practiced **index-based access** and **dynamic node creation**.

### 2️⃣ [Design Browser History](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-browser-history/)

- Simulate a browser’s back and forward navigation using a doubly linked list.
- Implemented `visit`, `back`, and `forward` operations.
- Reinforced the idea of **clearing forward history** when visiting a new page.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- Reinforces **pointer-based data structure design**.
- Introduces **real-world use cases** of doubly linked lists.
- Builds confidence in **designing custom data structures** from scratch.

✨ If I were a doubly linked list, I’d always keep a pointer to **you in both directions**—past and future! 😏💖
