# Stacks 🚀

🟢 **Fundamental Concept in DSA**

## 📌 Overview

Today, we explored **Stacks**, a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Stacks are widely used in **recursion, expression evaluation, undo operations, and memory management**. We applied this concept by solving three **LeetCode problems**, reinforcing our understanding of **stack operations and their real-world applications**.

## 🏆 Key Learnings

- **Push & Pop Operations** → Adding and removing elements from the stack.
- **LIFO Principle** → The last element added is the first to be removed.
- **Stack Applications** → Used in **expression validation, tracking history, and efficient data retrieval**.

## 📂 Problems Solved
