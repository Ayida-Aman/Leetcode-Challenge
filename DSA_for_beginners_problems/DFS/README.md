# Depth-First Search (DFS) 🔍🌳

🟢 **A Recursive Journey Through Trees**

## 📌 Overview

Today, we ventured deep into **Depth-First Search (DFS)** — a traversal strategy that dives into each branch before backtracking. Whether we’re visiting nodes in specific orders or constructing entire trees from abstract patterns, DFS unlocks the recursive soul of every binary tree.

Our solved problems showcased how DFS can **retrieve**, **rank**, and even **build** tree structures with elegant precision — revealing just how powerful recursion can be when paired with clear traversal logic.

## 🏆 Key Learnings

- **Traversal Orders Matter** → Preorder, Inorder, Postorder each reveal unique tree perspectives.
- **Recursive Control Flow** → Base cases and return paths are everything.
- **Global State Tracking** → Variables like counters and pointers drive contextual decisions mid-recursion.
- **Tree Reconstruction** → You can build entire trees using only traversal patterns!

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- DFS is the foundation of most tree algorithms — traversal, search, rank, and build.
- Visualizing call stacks and recursion trees helps debug and improve logic flow.
- Once DFS clicks, even the most nested structures feel navigable.
