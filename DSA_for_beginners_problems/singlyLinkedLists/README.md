# Singly Linked List 🚀  

🟢 **Fundamental Concept in DSA**  

## 📌 Overview  
Today, we explored **Singly Linked Lists**, a fundamental data structure where each node contains **data** and a **pointer to the next node**. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow **dynamic memory allocation**, making insertions and deletions more efficient.  

We applied this concept by solving two **LeetCode problems**, reinforcing our understanding of **list traversal, reversal, and merging operations**.  

## 🏆 Key Learnings  
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation** → Nodes are created dynamically, avoiding fixed-size constraints.  
- **Efficient Insertions & Deletions** → No need to shift elements like in arrays.  
- **Pointer-Based Navigation** → Each node links to the next, forming a chain-like structure.  

## 📂 Problems Solved  
### 1️⃣ **Reverse Linked List**  
🔗 [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)  
- Reverse a singly linked list **in-place**.  
- Implement both **iterative** and **recursive** solutions.  

### 2️⃣ **Merge Two Sorted Lists**  
🔗 [Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)  
- Merge two sorted linked lists into one **sorted** list.  
- Use **pointer manipulation** to efficiently combine nodes.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways  
- Reinforces **linked list traversal and manipulation**.  
- Introduces **efficient merging and reversal techniques**.  
- Builds confidence in **handling dynamic data structures**.
